# TrackIt – Finance Tracker Backend

TrackIt is a modular, database-driven personal finance tracking web application built using Flask.

The goal of this project was not just feature implementation, but to understand how production-style backend systems are structured — including API design, authentication, database persistence, and scalable architecture.
